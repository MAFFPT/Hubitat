# Hubitat<small><sup>&copy;</sup></small> File Driver (HFD)

# Introduction

This driver was developed to allow other developers to read/write/append files at the brand new (BETA) and powerfull local storage in the Hubitat<small><sup>&copy;</sup></small> Elevation hub.

It is intended to be a "provisory" solution, while Hubitat moves ahead with the BETA and awards us with a full API to access files from apps and drivers.

# How it works

This solution uses two components:

- A custom driver [Hubitat File Driver (HFD)](https://github.com/MAFFPT/Hubitat/blob/master/Hubitat%20File%20Driver%20(HFD)/driver/Hubitat%20File%20Driver%20(HFD).groovy)

- A Rule Machine rule
