Here you will find the instructions necessary to create two tiles for the Hubitat Elevation Dashboard.

One tile will allow control of the Nuki Smart Lock 2.0 itseft - open and close it. That tile will, also, show the current Lock status.

The other one will allow to see the status of the door sensor (contact sensor). It will show if the door is open or closed - or jammed!
