# Nuki Smart Lock 2.0<sup>&copy;</sup> Integration for Hubitat Elevation<sup>&copy;</sup>


## Introduction

These app and drivers were developed to overcome the lack of native support for the Nuki Smart Lock 2.0<sup>&copy;</sup> lock (https://nuki.io/en/) in the Hubitat Elevation<sup>&copy;</sup> (HE) home automation (domotics) system.

It is used an ‚ÄúIntegration‚Äù app that shields the user from the cumbersome task of configuring all the devices ‚Äì all the user has to do is to download the app and all drivers to his/hers Hubitat Elevation hub, run the app and **voil√°** ‚Äì the magic happens!

Well, that‚Äôs what at least I hope will happen ‚Ä¶

To keep this documentation short and its maintenance at a minimum level, the "on app" documentation is prioritized. Here you will not find *screenshots*. Not that I do not think they are important - I believe they are. However, as I said, I have prioritized providing the instructions on the app itself. This way I believe I can react to problems and/or user¬¥s needs faster.


## Organization

The material (app/drivers) is stored in two subfolders of **Apps & drivers** folder: '**production**' and '**debug**', with slightly but important differences between them.

Let's see them ...

### 'debug' folder

This folder contains all apps and drivers with a lot - I mean, a lot, a **massive** lot - of debugging code to help **you** help **me** to gather information when a problem is detected.

The debugging information will be logged - in your Hubitat Elevatiion hub system log - only when you toogle the "debug info logging" option at the main page of the apps/drivers. If you do not activate the "debug info logging" option, no debugging information will be logged whatsoever.

You may use this code as your production code. However, since there is a lot - did I mention a **massive** lot before? - of debugging code imbebbed into the apps/drivers code, it not only increases the execution time and may impact negatively the performance of your HE hub, but also increases the total code size.

### 'production' folder

This folder contains all apps and drivers striped off all the debugging code and even the "debug info logging" option - why keep it if it would be meaningless and produces nothing at all?

As I said before, this version of apps and drivers is meant to decrease possible overhead of the debugging code over your HE hub, even when the "debug info" is not enabled. I know that the overhead is minimum, but, if you add a lot of minimuns, it would not be a "minimum" anymore ...

But I will tell you one more reason to have a production and debug versions: the debug version code is ugly ... and I like my code to look nice from inside out. My therapist says that I should keep doing this as an occupational therapy to help me not to be sent back to the mental institution ... ü§™

### Wich app & drivers versions should I use?

I *strongly* suggest you to use the production versions and install the debugging versions only when a problem is detected.

However, it is your choice wich one you want to use.


## Installation

First of all you'll need to install the following app and drivers to your HE hub.

**Suggestion:** Open these links in a new browser tab so it will be easier for you to follow the instructions

## Supported devices

So far, the following Nuki products are supported by the app/drivers:

* Nuki bridge (firmware version ??? and above)
* Nuki Smart Lock 2.0 (firmware version ??? and above)

### To be supported soon ... stay tuned!

* Nuki Keypad
* Nuki Openner


## Operation

Once you have installed the app and pertinent drivers, the installation of your Nuki brige(s) and paired devices is straightforward: just open the app and follow the steps and, very important, _read carefully_ all the information contained on each page presented before requesting any action to the app - meaning, do not be a "fast clicker"! However, the app is - at least I hope it is ... - carefully crafted to alert you of any potential damaging operation *before* you act. So, _please read the all the information on each and every page before acting_ !!!
