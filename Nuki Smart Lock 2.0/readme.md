# Nuki Smart Lock 2.0<sup>&copy;</sup> Integration for Hubitat Elevation<sup>&copy;</sup>

## Introduction
These app and drivers were developed to overcome the lack of native support for the Nuki Smart Lock 2.0<sup>&copy;</sup> lock (https://nuki.io/en/) in the Hubitat Elevation<sup>&copy;</sup> (HE) system.

It uses an “Integration” app that shields the user from the cumbersome task of configuring all the devices – all the user has to do is to download the app and all drivers to his/hers Hubitat Elevation hub, install the app and voilá – the magic happens!

Well, that’s what at least I hope will happen …

## Installation

First of all you'll need to install the following app and drivers to your HE hub.
