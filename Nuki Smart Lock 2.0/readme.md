# Nuki Smart Lock 2.0<sup>&copy;</sup> Integration for Hubitat Elevation<sup>&copy;</sup>

## Introduction
These app and drivers were developed to overcome the lack of native support for the Nuki Smart Lock 2.0<sup>&copy;</sup> lock (https://nuki.io/en/) in the Hubitat Elevation<sup>&copy;</sup> (HE) system.

It uses an ‚ÄúIntegration‚Äù app that shields the user from the cumbersome task of configuring all the devices ‚Äì all the user has to do is to download the app and all drivers to his/hers Hubitat Elevation hub, install the app and voil√° ‚Äì the magic happens!

Well, that‚Äôs what at least I hope will happen ‚Ä¶

## Organization

This folder is divided into two subfolders, **production** and **debug**, with slightly between them.

Let's see them ...

### 'debug' folder

This folder contains all apps and drivers with a lot - I mean, a lot, a **massive** lot - of debugging code to help **you** help **me** to gather information when a problem is found.

The debugging information will be logged - in your Hubitat Elevatiion hub system log - only when you toogle the "debug info logging" option at the main page of the apps/drivers. If you do not activate the "debug info logging" option, no debugging information will be logged whatsoever.

You may use this code as your production code. However, since there is a lot - did I mention a **massive** lot before? - of debugging code imbebbed into the apps/drivers code, it not only increases the execution time and may impact negatively the performance of your HE hub, but also increases the total code size.

### 'production' folder

This folder contains all apps and drivers striped off all the debugging code and even the "debug info logging" option - why keep it if it would be meaningless and produces nothing at all?

As I said before, this version of apps and drivers is meant to decrease possible overhead of the debugging code over your HE hub, even when the "debug info" is not enabled. I know that the overhead is minimum, but, if you add a lot of minimuns, it would not be a "minimum" anymore ...

But I tell you one more reason to have a production and debug version: the debug version code is ugly ... and I like my code to look nice from inside out. My therapist says that I should keep doing this as an occupational therapy so it helps me not to be sent back to the mental institution ... ü§™

### Wich app & drivers version should I use?

I *strongly* suggest you to use the production versions and install the debugging versions only when a problem is found.

However, it is your choice wich one you want to use.
