# Nuki Smart Lock 2.0<sup>&copy;</sup> Integration for Hubitat Elevation<sup>&copy;</sup>

## Introduction
These app and drivers were developed to overcome the lack of native support of the Nuki Smart Lock 2.0<sup>&copy;</sup> (https://nuki.io/en/) to the Hubitat Elevation<sup>&copy;</sup> (HE) environment.

It uses an “Integration” app that shields the user from the cumbersome task of configuring all the devices – all the user has to do is to download the app and all drivers to his/hers Hubitat Elevation hub, install the app and voilá – the magic happens!

Well, that’s what at least I hope will happen …

## Installation
