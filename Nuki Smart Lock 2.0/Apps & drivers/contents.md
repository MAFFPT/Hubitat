# Apps & drivers

## Contents

Holds all the code for Nuki Smart Lock 2.0<sup>&copy;</sup> apps and drivers.

## debug subfolder

This folder contains all apps and drivers with a lot - I mean, a lot, a **massive** lot - of debugging code to help the user help me to gather information when a problem is found.

The debugging information will be logged when you toogle the "debug info" option at the main page of the apps/drivers.

You can use this code as your production code, since you don't activate the "debug info" option. However, since there is a lot - did I mention a **massive** lot? - of debugging code imbebbed into the apps/drivers code, it not only increases the execution time, but also increases the total code size.
