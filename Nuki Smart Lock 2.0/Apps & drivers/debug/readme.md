# Debug folder

This folder contains all apps and drivers with a lot - I mean, a lot, a **massive** lot - of debugging code to help **you** help **me** to gather information when a problem is found.

The debugging information will be logged - in your Hubitat Elevatiion hub system log - only when you toogle the "debug info logging" option at the main page of the apps/drivers. If you do not activate the "debug info logging" option, no debugging information will be logged whatsoever.

You may use this code as your production code. However, since there is a lot - did I mention a **massive** lot before? - of debugging code imbebbed into the apps/drivers code, it not only increases the execution time, but also increases the total code size.
