### production subfolder

This folder contains all apps and drivers striped off of all the debugging code and even the "debug info logging" option - why keep it if it would be meaningless and produces nothing at all?

As I said before, this version of apps and drivers is meant to decrease possible overhead of the debugging code over your HE hub, even when the "debug info" is not enabled. I know that the overhead is minimum, but, if you add a lot of minimuns, it would not be a "minimum" anymore ...
