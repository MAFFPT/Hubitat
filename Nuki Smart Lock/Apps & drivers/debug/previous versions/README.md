# 'previous versions' folder

This folder contains all the previous versions of apps and drivers.

If unfortunatelly you are faced with a new version of an app or driver that causes an error, please come here and select the most recently old version. This way your Nuki devices can get back to work again.

But, please do not forget to report the problem that you have found since I can look at it.

Good luck!

NOTE: As of 2020-12-22, only the updated files will be stored at the versions folders; so, the unaltered files will not be stored.
