### 'production' folder

This folder contains all apps and drivers striped off all the debugging code and even the "debug info logging" option - why keep it if it would be meaningless and produces nothing at all?

As I said before, this version of apps and drivers is meant to decrease possible overhead of the debugging code over your HE hub, even when the "debug info" is not enabled. I know that the overhead is minimum, but, if you add a lot of minimuns, it would not be a "minimum" anymore ...

But I tell you one more reason to have a production and debug version: the debug version code is ugly ... and I like my code to look nice from inside out. My therapist says that I should keep doing this as an occupational therapy so it helps me not to be sent back to the mental institution ... ðŸ¤ª
